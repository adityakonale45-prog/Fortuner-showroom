Toyota Fortuner production is centered in India at Toyota Kirloskar Motor's (TKM) Bidadi plant, assembling CKD kits to meet strong local demand, with recent updates including a mild-hybrid "Neo Drive" version for better efficiency, while facing potential future impacts from stricter emission norms (BS7) requiring engine updates or changes. 
<h2><u>HISTORY</u></h2>
The Toyota Fortuner, launched globally in 2004 and India in 2009, is a robust body-on-frame SUV built on the IMV platform (shared with Hilux, Innova) known for its ruggedness in tough road conditions, quickly becoming a segment leader despite early flaws like a bumpy ride, with significant facelifts in 2012, 2016 (second gen), and 2021 (facelift/Legender), adding modern tech, better engines, and automatic options while maintaining its strong off-road appeal.

<h2><u>QUALITY RANKING </u></h2>
The Toyota Fortuner ranks highly for quality, especially in reliability, safety (5-star ASEAN NCAP), rugged build, and strong resale value, making it a top choice for a robust SUV, though its ladder-frame construction can lead to a bouncy ride on rough roads. Users and experts praise its powerful performance, low maintenance, and imposing road presence, while some note its ride comfort isn't as plush as monocoque SUVs.
